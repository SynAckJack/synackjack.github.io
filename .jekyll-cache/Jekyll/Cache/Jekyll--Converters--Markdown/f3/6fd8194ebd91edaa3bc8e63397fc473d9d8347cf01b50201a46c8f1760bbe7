<p>Over summer last year, I picked up a fantastic book from Jaron Bradley, <a href="https://amzn.to/35daPGh">OS X Incident Response: Scripting and Analysis</a>, which covers the development of an incident response (ir) tool for macOS. Originally I was thinking about developing something to reverse engineer iOS apps, but in all honesty Iâ€™m not the best at RE soâ€¦Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>

<p>So macOS-ir is a <strong>very</strong> prototype tool to collect data from a compromised macOS device and analyse it. Itâ€™s written in bash and requires no tools to be installed to collect the information <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once the data has been collected, it can be transferred using one of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Save directly to USB drive</li>
  <li>Save to a local disk image</li>
  <li>Transfer over network using <code class="highlighter-rouge">netcat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the data is encrypted (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">OpenSSL</code>) so if the USB is lost, for example, then any sensitive data that is collected, well nobody is getting it.</p>

<p>The analysis script is designed to install any required tools. This prompts to install Xcode tools and installs Homebrew along with required tools using an included <code class="highlighter-rouge">Brewfile</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And bam. Give it the name of the USB drive, path to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.dmg</code> on the disk image or start listening with <code class="highlighter-rouge">netcat</code> and itâ€™ll start doing itâ€™s stuff. The analysis isnâ€™t (at this stage) designed to say â€œHey, this is maliciousâ€ or â€œYou know you have this malware installedâ€ but it aims to summarise data and look for items that arenâ€™t as they should be and highlight them.</p>

<p>The output of this tool is a range of PDF files. A main PDF file (stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\tmp\[Compromised device hostname]\[hostname].pdf</code>) contains the summary of the data. Within the same folder a series of other secondary PDF files are generated which contain the rest of the data. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.apps</code> that are unsigned are shown in the main PDF, but all the others are contained in a secondary. It normally goes, <strong>if the data is too large or canâ€™t be narrowed down, itâ€™s in a secondary PDF</strong>.</p>

<p>And that is that. A very brief overview of <code class="highlighter-rouge">macOS-ir</code> (Iâ€™m trying to think of a shorter name, but Iâ€™m stuck). Iâ€™m thinking about writing more, breaking down the collection and analysis stages further. Maybe smaller posts including interesting things that I came across, maybe break it down function by function. I donâ€™t know. But hey, this is a start.</p>

      <p>Although it does benefit if XCode tools is installed. Notarization of .apps can be checked.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Tools can be installed without any analysis with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> flag.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
